Security & Safety (MVP-Realistic)

Internal endpoints protected by API key (local dev)

No arbitrary command execution

Every action has bounded blast radius (TTL, +1 replica)

Approval required by default

Evidence-first: actions must cite evidence and meet thresholds


==============================================

Post-MVP Upgrades (Only After MVP Works)

Replace denylist middleware with Envoy/nginx rate limit or NetworkPolicy

Add trace correlation for root cause

Add pgvector retrieval of prior incidents + runbooks

Add third scenario: rollback bad deploy

Add richer policy engine (OPA/Rego) once the basics are proven
